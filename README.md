# keyboardjs-rails

[KeyboardJS](http://robertwhurst.github.com/KeyboardJS/), typed up for Rails 3.0 and up. Sweet!


## Rails 3.1+

For Rails 3.1 and greater, the files will be added to the asset pipeline and available for you to use.

To enable: 

* Add the following line to the file `app/assets/javascripts/application.js` (or other [sprockets](https://github.com/sstephenson/sprockets) manifest):

``` javascript
//= require keyboardjs
```


### Installation

* Add `keyboardjs-rails` to your Gemfile
* Run `bundle`

Enjoy!


## Rails 3.0

This gem adds a single generator to Rails 3, `keyboardjs:install`. Running the generator will install the JavaScript file necessary to use KeyboardJS.

### Installation

* Add `keyboardjs-rails` to your Gemfile
* Run `bundle`
* Invoke the generator: `rails generate keyboardjs:install`
* Add the following to your layout or view files:

```erb
<%= javascript_include_tag "keyboardjs" %>
```

You're done!
